# pythonGames
a compilation of all the games i have made using python, currently only a memory game and 2048

## usage
the memory game was made to help small children learn english, currently it is on test mode, which can be easily changed, this means that the cards of the memory game are both revealed and in order
the 2048 game has an easy and hard mode, easy mode stops when no available moves are left or you have a 2048 tile on board, hard mode stops as soon as the board fill up or if you have a 2048 tile on board
